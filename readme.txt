This plugin moves the category list to the sidebar at the Write Post page, and nothing else.

== Description ==

WordPress 2.5 changed our blogging life in both good and bad ways. One awful change is the categories section - why the "bleep" does it have to be at the bottom of the page, man? Anyways, this plugin removes that section below and adds a primitive, yet sufficient category selector to the sidebar.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `category-selector-back-to-the-sidebar` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate it.
1. Done.
